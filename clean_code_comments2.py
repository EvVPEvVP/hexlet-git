# This function returns a list of words from a given text file, removing any stop words

Reminder comments:

# Reminder: This variable is in meters, but the calculation expects it in centimeters
height_in_meters = 1.8
height_in_centimeters = height_in_meters * 100  # convert to centimeters

"Why" comments:

# Why we use a try-except block here: if the file doesn't exist, we want to handle the error gracefully
try:
    with open('data.txt') as f:
        data = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: file not found")
